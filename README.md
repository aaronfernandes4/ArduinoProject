# ArduinoProject
Total Plant Health & Environment Monitoring System
Automatic Plant Hydrating System with a Buzzer
The idea behind this Arduino-based project was given that India is an agricultural based country and the fact that most Indians too have small gardens/lawns of their own, this project make sure that most of the menial work could be eliminated and could create a self-reliant environment of its own.

The main parts of the project were:

• Coding the Arduino board to perform the required functions.

• Temperature and humidity sensor which would provide the temperature and humidity and display them on the LED screen.

• An automatic water pump that provides water to the plants whenever the soil moisture sensor detected the absence of water in the soil.

• A Buzzer with a PIR motion sensor that would detect the motion of birds/Insects and go off until the motion sensor doesn't detect any unnecessary motion.

• A mechanical arm attached to a servo motor that would move to scare away birds/insects simultaneously with the buzzer and work as a scarecrow.

• A LED light indicating all functions of the TP-HEMS were functioning properly without any irregularities.


Goals of the project:

• Automizing farming and agricultural-based activities.

• Eliminating menial labor and providing constant attention to well being of the garden environment.


Future Scope:

• Could be made into a large-scale system for farming.

• Add features such as nodemcu would provide constant updates and notifications regarding the health and maintenance of the garden on any of the client's devices.

• Light sensors could be added for positioning for optimal growth.
